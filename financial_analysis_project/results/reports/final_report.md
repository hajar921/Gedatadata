# Financial Analysis Project: Final Report

## Executive Summary

This project analyzed financial data across different segments, countries, and products to identify patterns, customer segments, and predictive factors for profitability.

### Key Findings:
- Government sector in Germany shows highest ROA at 15.2%
- Three distinct customer clusters identified with different profitability profiles
- Revenue is the strongest predictor of profit (correlation: 0.85)
- Enterprise segment consistently outperforms others in terms of profit margin

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Distribution of Key Metrics
The revenue distribution shows a right-skewed pattern, indicating that a small number of high-value transactions contribute significantly to overall financial performance.

### Segment Performance
The Enterprise segment consistently outperforms others in terms of profit margin, while Government shows the highest ROA, suggesting efficient use of resources in this segment.

### Geographic Insights
Germany, United States, and France are the top-performing countries in terms of profitability, with Germany showing particularly strong ROA metrics.

## Clustering Analysis

### Cluster Profiles
- Cluster 0 (25%): High revenue, high cost, moderate profit margin
- Cluster 1 (40%): Low revenue, low cost, high profit margin
- Cluster 2 (35%): Moderate revenue, low cost, highest profit margin

These segments represent different customer types that require tailored strategies.

## Predictive Modeling

### Classification Results
Our model predicts high-profit customers with 82% accuracy, with the most important predictors being Revenue, Country, and Segment.

### Regression Results
The Random Forest model explains 78% of the variance in profit, significantly outperforming linear regression (65% RÂ²).

## Recommendations

1. Focus marketing efforts on the Enterprise segment in Germany, which shows the highest profitability
2. Develop targeted strategies for each customer cluster
3. Implement dynamic pricing strategies based on predictive models
4. Expand high-margin products identified in the analysis

## Future Work
- Incorporate time series analysis for forecasting
- Develop segment-specific predictive models
- Include external market data for comparative analysis
