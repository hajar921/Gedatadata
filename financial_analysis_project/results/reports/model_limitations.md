# Model Limitations

## Clustering Limitations
- K-means assumes spherical clusters of similar size
- Results are sensitive to initial centroid placement
- The optimal number of clusters is subjective
- Does not handle categorical variables directly

## Classification Limitations
- Limited by the quality and representativeness of training data
- May not generalize well to new market conditions
- Feature importance doesn't imply causality
- Class imbalance affects model performance

## Regression Limitations
- Assumes linear relationships for linear models
- May not capture complex interactions without explicit feature engineering
- Sensitive to outliers, especially linear models
- Limited temporal analysis due to cross-sectional nature of data

## General Limitations
- No external market data for comparison
- Limited temporal data for time series analysis
- No customer demographic information
- Models don't account for macroeconomic factors
